Two parameters to be mentioned, distance \ud835\udefc of the axial points, \nnumber of  centre runs \ud835\udc56\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc36\n3.

The factors \nwere the water-to-cement ratio, the percent of black liquor added, and the \npercent of SNF added. The response variable is plasticity. The left side of the \ntable shows the coded factors \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd3. The axial points were chosen at \u00b11.68 \nin coded units to make the design rotatable. The coded levels are found as \n(actual level \u2212 center value)/(half-range). For example, x2 = (BlackLiq: \u2212 \n0.150)/0.03.\n(Source: Design and Analysis of Experiments with R,\nJohn Lawson)\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nCentral Composite Design (CCD)\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nBox Behnken Design\n\u2022 CCD requires 5 levels (\u2212\ud835\udefc, \u22121, 0, +1, +\ud835\udefc) for each factor, Box and Behnken \n(1960) developed some three level designs.\n\u2022  BBD allows estimation of the general quadratic model. \n\u2022 BBD consists of 22 factorials in each pair of factors \n   with all other factors held constant at their mid-level and a \n   few center points.\n\u2022  No Box-Behnken design exists for only two factors.\nSource:\nDesign and Analysis of Experiments with R,\nJohn Lawson\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nBox Behnken Design\n\u2022 Box-Behnken designs have two advantages over CCDs. \n\u2022 BBD only require that factors be varied over three levels, reducing experimental cost for \nbuilding prototypes.\n\u2022 BBD usually (except for the 5-factor case) require less total runs than the CCD.\n\u2022 A disadvantage of a Box-Behnken design compared to a CCD is that it cannot \nbe built up in two steps beginning with a 2\ud835\udc56\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd design.\n\u2022 BBD should be used if the experimenter is reasonably sure that a linear model \nwill not adequately represent the relationship between the factors and the \nresponse, and he or she wants to save a few runs.\n\u2022 BBD is not rotatable, but close enough to being rotatable and having uniform \nprecision for practical use. \n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nBBD Example\n\u2022 As an example of a Box-Behnken design, consider the experiment performed\n  by Anderson (2003). He experimented with a scale model trebuchet (medieval\nmissile launcher) that was issued to all engineering students at the South\nDakota School of Mines and Technology for hands-on experimentation. He\nwanted to determine the settings that would allow him to toss an object a\ngiven distance.\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nBBD Example\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nResponse Surface Method (Ch11, DOE, Montgomery)\n\u2022 Mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the influence of factors over \nthe response variable and optimize the same\n\u2022 \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ud835\udc50\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1, \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2 + \ud835\udf16\n\u2022 Expected response \ud835\udc37\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ud835\udc50\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1, \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2 = \ud835\udf02\n\u2022 Surface representing \ud835\udf02 is the response surface\nDesign and Analysis of Experiment, D.C.

\nvalues of others are constrained to desirable range.\n\u2022 Desirability function approach: Proposed by Derringer and Suich (1980). \nConvert each response \ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc56 to individual desirability values \ud835\udc50\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc56 such that \n   \ud835\udfce \u2264 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc8a \u2264

---\n\nMultiple Response Example\n\u2022 A chemical engineer is interested in determining the operating conditions that \nmaximize the yield of a process (\ud835\udc99\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udfce\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd). \n\u2022 Two controllable variables influence process yield: reaction time (\ud835\udc99\ud835\udfce\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) and \nreaction temperature (\ud835\udc99\ud835\udfce\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd). \n\u2022 The engineer is currently operating the process with a reaction time of 35 \nminutes and a temperature of 155\u00b0F, result in yields of around 40%.\n\u2022 It is unlikely that this region contains the optimum, she fits a first-order model \nand applies the method of steepest ascent.\n\u2022 In the optimal region found using steepest ascent a CCD is created with \nexperimental runs. \n\u2022 2 additional responses, viscocity (\ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2) and molecular weight (\ud835\udc5f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd3) are also \nrecorded.\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nMultiple Response Example\nSource: Montgomery, D.
